Place these scripts in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts` on your
RedHat/CentOS/Fedora system.

Sample configuration for a `macvlan` interface:

    TYPE=macvlan
    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=yes
    NM_CONTROLLED=no

    MACVLAN_PARENT=em1
    MACVLAN_MODE=bridge

- `TYPE` can be either `macvlan` or `macvtap`.
- `MACVLAN_PARENT` is the name of the physical interface with which
  this `macvlan` interface is associated.
- `MACVLAN_MODE` can be `private`, `bridge`, `vepa`, or `passthru`.
  See [this commit][1] for more information.
